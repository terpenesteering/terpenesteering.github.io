        <h2>Welcome to Terpene Steering</h2>
        <p>Terpene steering refers to the process of manipulating the terpene profile of plants, particularly cannabis, to enhance specific characteristics such as flavor, aroma, and medicinal properties. By understanding and controlling the terpene composition, cultivators can create strains with desired effects and benefits. Terpenes play a crucial role in the unique characteristics of different cannabis strains. They can influence not only the flavor and aroma but also the therapeutic effects of the cannabis.</p>

        <h2>About Terpene Steering</h2>
        <p>Terpenes are aromatic compounds found in many plants, and they play a crucial role in the flavor and fragrance of cannabis. Terpene steering involves the deliberate cultivation practices aimed at enhancing or altering these terpenes. This technique can be used to optimize the therapeutic effects, improve the sensory experience, and increase the commercial value of cannabis products. By carefully controlling factors such as light, nutrients, and environmental conditions, cultivators can influence the terpene profile of their crops.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal of terpene steering is to produce cannabis with a consistent and desirable terpene profile that enhances the overall user experience. Whether you are a grower looking to create the next big strain or a consumer seeking the perfect flavor and aroma, understanding terpene steering is key to unlocking the full potential of cannabis.</p>

    <section id="how-to">
        <h2>How to Guide: Terpene Steering</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the right strain: Choose a strain with a terpene profile that aligns with your goals. Research different strains to find those known for their rich terpene content.</li>
            <li>Optimize growing conditions: Ensure your plants receive the right amount of light, water, and nutrients. Tailor your cultivation techniques to promote healthy plant growth and robust terpene production.</li>
            <li>Use specific nutrients: Certain nutrients can influence terpene production. Incorporate nutrient-rich fertilizers and organic compost to boost terpene synthesis.</li>
            <li>Monitor temperature: Maintain optimal temperature ranges to preserve terpenes. High temperatures can degrade these delicate compounds, so aim for a stable and moderate environment.</li>
            <li>Control humidity: High humidity can degrade terpenes; keep it in check. Use dehumidifiers and proper ventilation to manage moisture levels effectively.</li>
            <li>Harvest at the right time: Timing is crucial to capturing the best terpene profile. Harvest your plants when the trichomes are at their peak to maximize terpene retention.</li>
            <li>Dry and cure properly: Proper drying and curing preserve and enhance terpenes. Slow drying and careful curing allow the terpenes to mature and develop their full potential.</li>
            <li>Store correctly: Use airtight containers in cool, dark places to maintain terpene quality. Protect your buds from light, heat, and oxygen to keep the terpenes intact.</li>
            <li>Experiment with supplements: Some growers use supplements like molasses to boost terpene production. Explore natural additives and biostimulants that can enhance terpene profiles.</li>
            <li>Regularly test your product: Lab testing can provide insights into your terpene profile and help guide adjustments. Use the data to refine your growing techniques and achieve the desired results.</li>
        </ol>
